### Osteoporosis Detection Web Application

This repository contains a Flask backend integrated with a simple web user interface for uploading and displaying predictions on osteoporosis detection using images. The backend incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained with Keras for this specific task.

#### Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to allow users to upload an image via the web interface and receive a prediction on whether the uploaded image indicates osteoporosis or not.

### Tools Used
- **Flask:** Used to develop the backend of the web application.
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap:** Employed for the user interface design and functionality.
- **Keras (with CNN):** Implemented for training the model for osteoporosis detection.

#### Project Structure

The project has two primary components:

##### Backend
- The Flask backend handles image uploading, processes the image through the trained CNN model, and returns the prediction.
- It loads the pre-trained CNN model and performs predictions on the uploaded images.

##### Frontend (Web UI)
- The web interface allows users to upload images and displays the predictions regarding osteoporosis detection.
- It provides a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring an intuitive experience for image upload and prediction display.

#### How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the Flask environment and ensure dependencies are installed.
3. Run the Flask server locally.
4. Access the application via the web interface.
5. Upload an image for osteoporosis detection.
6. Receive the prediction output regarding the likelihood of osteoporosis based on the uploaded image.

#### Important Note
The prediction provided by the model is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a definitive diagnosis. Consultation with a healthcare professional is strongly advised for accurate osteoporosis assessment and diagnosis.

#### Future Developments
The project is open to further development, potentially incorporating more sophisticated models, improving the user interface, and enhancing prediction accuracy.
